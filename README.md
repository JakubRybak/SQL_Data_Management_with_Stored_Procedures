# SQL_Data_Management_with_Stored_Procedures
## Overview

This project is a university laboratory assignment focused on designing and implementing a sophisticated reservation system using SQL. The system, centered around a theatre booking model, involves creating a relational database, populating it with sample data, developing a complex stored procedure for managing reservations using cursors, and optimizing database performance through indexing. The project emphasizes adherence to technical requirements such as transaction management, error handling, and atomicity of data operations.
